Monitaur Jobs
=============

These are the jobs that are currently run as part of [Monitaur's
service](http://monitaur.net/).

You may fork these jobs, edit them, and use them for your own purposes.
Eventually, we will allow you to specify a GitHub repository to use for
monitoring your own servers jobs.

Jobs are expected to return a white-space delimited list of numbers. The job
completion time is used for the timestamp.
